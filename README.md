# Open Up The Cloud "Hangout"(s)

A collection of Open Up The Cloud "hangout" events. These are conversations with the community, open to anyone, and are intended to be as friendly and open as possible. Come hangout with us at the next event! üôè Check the [Github Issues](https://github.com/openupthecloud/hangout/issues/1) for details of the next event(s). In line with the general [mission of Open Up The Cloud](https://openupthecloud.com/mission) these spaces are conducted in an open, public way so that folks can join, interact and ask questions. Think less "panel" style and more "meetup" where folks can join us "on stage" and ask questions. Most spaces are conducted with a mix of backgrounds and experiences, to bring diversity to the conversation/dynamic.

**FAQ's**

**Will it be recorded?** Yes. Twitter hosts the recording for a short period of time, to be listened after the event. I'll potentially host these somewhere else, e.g. a podcast in future, but that doesn't exist yet. 

**Can I propose an idea?** Yes, [send me a DM](https://twitter.com/loujaybee). If the topic is already an issue, comment the GitHub issue with questions, thoughts, ideas, speaker suggestions or to ask to be a guest on the panel.
